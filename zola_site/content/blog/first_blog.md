# Origin?

One might wonder, how did the nickname "Vanbuncha" come into existence?

Picture this: a young me, an enthusiastic fan of a game called football. In 2012, a movie called "Okresní přebor" was still at the peak of its fame. Of course, being the only Asian on a football team full of cheerful kids and adults, a new nickname was given to me: "Fun Din Dung".

As popular as it was amongst my peers, it was not an original nickname until one day, one of my coaches, perhaps out of pure joy, exclaimed, "Van bún cùng chả" (but in a Czech accent, of course). This dish was becoming a staple Vietnamese <a href="https://delightfulplate.com/vietnamese-grilled-pork-meatballs-noodles-bun-cha/">dish</a> in Czech Republic. Thus, a nickname was born. It was immortalized on September 6th, 2012, by creating the email vanbuncha.nguyen, an email that is still used to this day.


## Evolution

Throughout the years, many nicknames came and went, such as "Wafik"*, which is used as an ign in League of Legends or "vanba" ("Văn Ba"), which has its historic origin from being an alias of Ho Chi Minh during his stay on a French merchant steamer**.


## Present

While many nicknames were used, no better one was invented than "Vanbuncha". Thus, it is still used despite its joke origin or possible derogatory connotation to one's ethnic origin.

<i>It's all a joke and fun after all, haha!</i>



Notes:

*Wafik - Muslim Boy name meaning successful. <br>
** Amiral de Latouche-Tréville
