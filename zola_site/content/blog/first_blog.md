# Origin?

One might ponder how did the nick vanbuncha come to the existence? 

Picture this a young me an enthusiastic fan of game called football. In 2012 a movie called Okresní přebor was still still in a peak of its fame. Ofcourse being a single asian in a football team full of cheerfull kids and adults a new nickname was given to me Fun Din Dung. 

As popular as it was amongst my peers it was no original nickname.. Untill a coach of mine one day out of perhaps pure joy exclaimed "Van bún cùng chả" (but in czech accent ofc.) as this dish was becoming a staple vietnamesse <a href="https://delightfulplate.com/vietnamese-grilled-pork-meatballs-noodles-bun-cha/">dish</a> in Czech Rep.. Thus a nickname was born. Immortalized on 6th of September 2012 by creating vanbuncha.nguyen email. An email that is used to this day.

## Evolution

Throughout the years many nicknames came and went by. Such as Wafik* which is used as ign in League of Legends or vanba "Văn Ba" which has its historic origin from being an alias of Ho Chi Minh during his stay on a French merchant steamer**.

## Present

While many nicknames were used no better one was invented other than vanbuncha. Thus it is still used despite being of such joke origin or possible derogatory call out of one's ethnic origin. 

<i>It's all joke and fun after all haha</i>



Notes:

*Wafik - Muslim Boy name meaning successful. <br>
** Amiral de Latouche-Tréville
