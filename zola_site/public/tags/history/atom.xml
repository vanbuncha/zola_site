&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered how the nickname &quot;vanbuncha&quot; came to be? Well, let me tell you the story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture this: it was 2012, and I was a young and enthusiastic fan of football. I was the only Asian on a team full of cheerful kids and adults, and as a result, they gave me the nickname &quot;Fun Din Dung&quot;. While it was popular amongst my peers, it wasn&#x27;t an original nickname until one day, my coach exclaimed &quot;Van bÃºn cuÍ€ng cháº£&quot; (in a Czech accent), referring to a Vietnamese dish that was becoming popular in the Czech Republic. And just like that, a new nickname was born.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 6th, 2012, I immortalized this new nickname by creating the email vanbuncha.nguyen, which I still use to this day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, other nicknames have come and gone, such as &quot;Wafik&quot; (which means successful in Arabic) and &quot;vanba&quot; (derived from Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s alias during his stay on a French merchant steamer). But none of them have stuck like &quot;vanbuncha&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its joke origin and possible derogatory connotation to my ethnic origin, I still use the nickname to this day. After all, it&#x27;s all in good fun!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
